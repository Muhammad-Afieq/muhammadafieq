# ASSIGNMENT
   Industry Talk and Industry Visit:                                                                                                                                                                        
      From the industry talk and visit, I gained exposure to how real industries operate beyond what we learn in class. The speakers shared insights about current industry practices, required skills, and       expectations from fresh graduates. This helped me understand the importance of soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management, alongside technical knowledge. Seeing the actual working environment also gave me a clearer picture of career paths related to my field and how classroom learning connects to real job roles.
                                                                                                                                                           
PC Assemble (Lab)                                                                                                       
For the PC assembly lab, I learned the function of each hardware component and how they work together to form a complete system. Disassembling the PC before assembling it helped me understand the structure and connections more clearly. Working in a group improved my teamwork and communication skills, as each member had a role during the process. This hands-on experience increased my confidence in handling computer hardware.Also a quiz that help me memorized each step for each step to prevent any damage in PC.

Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype):                                                                                                                                
Through the design thinking assignment, I learned how to approach problems systematically. The process of identifying user needs, brainstorming ideas, and developing a low-fidelity prototype helped me think more creatively and logically. Creating a simple prototype allowed us to visualize ideas early and improve them based on feedback. This assignment showed me that effective solutions come from understanding users, not just focusing on technology.
