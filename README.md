# ASSIGNMENT
   Industry Talk at UTM Digital Open Day:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
On that day, I was given the opportunity to attend an industrial talk by Mr. Helmee Bin Yaakob on system development. From the talk, I learned how UTM Digital operates efficiently to support students and how its systems function. He also shared details about project failures, which helped prepare me for challenges I may face in university and in future workplaces.

We also had the opportunity to interview one of the employees, Muhammad Farid Bin Mohd Ariffin, who works as a system developer for research and development information systems. Through this interview, many of our questions and curiosities were answered clearly, which further enhanced my understanding of real-world system development.

As an improvement, longer and more interactive question-and-answer sessions would allow students to gain deeper insight into system development practices and industry challenges. Overall, this experience gave me a more realistic view of professional system development, increased my motivation to learn, and highlighted the importance of communication, teamwork, and continuous learning for a future career in technology..
                                                                                                                                                           
PC Assemble (Lab)                                                                                                       
For the PC assembly lab, I learned the function of each hardware component and how they work together to form a complete system. Disassembling the PC before assembling it helped me understand the structure and connections more clearly. Working in a group improved my teamwork and communication skills, as each member had a role during the process. This hands-on experience increased my confidence in handling computer hardware.Also a quiz that help me memorized each step for each step to prevent any damage in PC.

Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype):                                                                                                                                
Through the design thinking assignment, I learned how to approach problems systematically. The process of identifying user needs, brainstorming ideas, and developing a low-fidelity prototype helped me think more creatively and logically. Creating a simple prototype allowed us to visualize ideas early and improve them based on feedback. This assignment showed me that effective solutions come from understanding users, not just focusing on technology.
